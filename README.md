# Python Rule-Based Chatbot

A simple, interactive chatbot built using **Python** and basic `if-elif-else` logic. This lightweight script demonstrates fundamental NLP concepts and conversational flow—all without any external libraries.

##  Overview

- **Objective:** Simulate a rule-based chatbot using user input/output loops and conditional statements.
- **Tools:** Pure Python (no external dependencies required).
- **Deliverable:** A script (`chatbot.py`) that engages in a text-based conversation with the user.
- **Outcome:** Understand the structure of basic conversational AI workflows and conditional logic.

##  Features

Depending on input, the chatbot can respond to:
- Greetings (`hi`, `hello`, `good morning`, etc.)
- Emotional cues (`how are you`, “I am sad/good”)
- Personal questions (`your name`, `my name is ...`)
- Fun prompts (`joke`, `fact`)
- Date & time queries
- Casual chatter about purpose or hobbies
- Goodbye triggers (`bye`, `exit`, `see you`)

Unrecognized messages prompt a friendly “I didn’t get that” response.

##  Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Running the Chatbot

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adnanshafi26/python-chatbot.git
   cd python-chatbot
````

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

3. Chat away! Type `bye` to exit.

## Example Conversation

```
🤖 ChatBot: Hello! I'm your friendly chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.
You: hi
🤖 ChatBot: Hi there! How’s your day going?
You: my name is Sarah
🤖 ChatBot: Nice to meet you, Sarah! 😄
You: tell me a joke
🤖 ChatBot: Why don’t skeletons fight each other? Because they don’t have the guts! 😂
You: what’s the time?
🤖 ChatBot: The current time is 14:30:45.
You: bye
🤖 ChatBot: Goodbye! Have a great day ahead! 👋
```

## Next Steps (Ideas for Enhancement)

* **Name Memory:** Store your name in a file so the bot can remember you across sessions.
* **Randomized Responses:** Have multiple jokes or facts and serve them randomly.
* **CLI Arguments:** Allow custom greetings or behaviors passed via command-line flags.
* **GUI Frontend:** Create a simple GUI using Tkinter or a web interface using Flask/Streamlit.
* **Contextual Chat:** Improve naturalness by tracking recent conversation topics.
